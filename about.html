            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>We believe AI skills should be accessible to every professional in Oxford, not just technical specialists. Our evening classes provide practical, hands-on training in small cohorts where everyone gets personal attention and real support.</p>

            <p>Unlike online courses that leave you isolated or expensive university programs with long wait times, we deliver focused, actionable learning that fits your busy schedule. Face-to-face, one evening per week, with people just like you.</p>

            <h2>Why We're Different</h2>

            <h3>Small Cohorts, Big Results</h3>
            <p>We cap every class at 12 students (target 10). This isn't a lecture hall—it's a collaborative workshop where you get individual feedback, ask questions freely, and build real skills through hands-on practice.</p>

            <h3>Hyper-Local & Face-to-Face</h3>
            <p>Oxford is home to world-class universities, innovative SMEs, the NHS, and countless professionals seeking to upskill. Our in-person format creates accountability, enables networking, and provides the kind of guided learning that remote courses simply can't match.</p>

            <h3>Highly Practical</h3>
            <p>Every session includes hands-on labs and real-world applications. You'll work on mini-projects relevant to your job, get feedback from an experienced instructor, and leave with skills you can use immediately.</p>

            <h3>Three Clear Pathways</h3>
            <p>Whether you're a complete beginner, an intermediate user seeking mastery, or a technical professional ready to build AI agents, we have the right course for you. Progress at your own pace through our three-level curriculum.</p>

            <h2>Our Teaching Philosophy</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Jobs to be done:</strong> We focus on what you want to accomplish—"use AI confidently at work," "automate recurring tasks," "build a data-driven prototype"—not just abstract theory.</li>
                <li><strong>Safety & ethics first:</strong> We teach responsible AI use, bias awareness, and critical evaluation from day one.</li>
                <li><strong>Immediate applicability:</strong> Every technique you learn can be applied to your work the next day.</li>
                <li><strong>Supportive community:</strong> Join a network of Oxford professionals learning AI together, with ongoing support via Discord and office hours.</li>

            <h2>Our Instructor</h2>
            <p>Christian Fitz-Gibbon brings over 20 years of hands-on software engineering experience to Oxford AI Training, with deep expertise in building AI-powered systems, data platforms, and intelligent automation solutions.</p>

            <p>As Head of Engineering at Observe Technologies and former Lead Engineer at Zenobē Energy, Christian has architected and delivered production AI systems serving millions of users. His work spans everything from IoT platforms processing real-time data streams to enterprise-scale systems leveraging modern AI capabilities. He's contributed to industry standards with the Open Charge Alliance and led engineering transformations across multiple organizations.</p>

            <p>Christian's technical foundation combines TypeScript, Python, cloud architecture (AWS), and practical experience with modern AI tools and workflows. More importantly, he understands the gap between AI hype and real-world application—he's spent years translating complex technical concepts into solutions that work for actual businesses and users.</p>

            <p>Based in Oxford, Christian designed these courses specifically for working professionals who need practical skills, not theory. His teaching approach mirrors his engineering philosophy: clear, actionable, and focused on outcomes. Whether you're taking your first steps with AI tools or building sophisticated agent workflows, you'll benefit from instruction grounded in real production experience.</p>

            <p>When he's not teaching or coding, Christian is likely exploring Oxford's coffee shops or planning his next AI experiment.</p>
