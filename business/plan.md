## 2) Market & Customer

- **Oxford advantage:** dense base of universities, NHS, labs, SMEs, and professionals seeking upskilling; evening, in‑person learning preferred for accountability and networking.

  - Professionals (marketing, HR, ops) pursuing productivity gains.
  - Technically curious & founders seeking agentic/automation skills.

- **Jobs to be done:** “Use AI confidently at work”, “save time via prompts/workflows”, “prototype a data/agent use‑case.”
- **Competitors:** MOOCs and remote bootcamps (lower accountability), university short courses (higher price, slower to schedule). **Differentiator:** highly practical, hyper‑local, small‑group coaching.

## 7) Financial Plan (Base‑case)

**Key assumptions**

- **Cohort capacity:** 10 (max 12).
- **Average blend price:** £174 (50% Beginners, 30% Intermediate, 20% Advanced).
- **Venue hire:** **£45/hr**, charged **2 hrs/session** → **£90**.
- **Refreshments:** **£15/session**.
- **Materials:** **£2/student/course**.
- **Payment fees:** **3.5%** of revenue.
- **Fixed monthly:** insurance £25 + website/booking £20 + misc £30 = **£75**; marketing **£200** (months 1–3), then **£120**/mo.
- **Owner pay (optional):** £50/hr × **1.5 hr/session** × 4 sessions = **£300 per course**.

**Delivery ramp (Year 1)**
M1: 1 course @ 6 students → scale to steady‑state M7+: **3 courses/month @ 9 students**.

**Year‑1 totals**

- **Revenue:** **£40,716**
- **Variable costs:** **£13,653**
- **Gross profit:** **£27,063**
- **Fixed costs:** **£2,580**
- **Operating profit (pre owner pay):** **£24,483**
- **Owner pay:** **£8,400** (112 sessions)
- **Operating profit (after owner pay):** **£16,083** (pre‑tax)

**Per‑course unit economics (steady‑state)**

- Revenue = **£174 × students**
- Variable costs/course = venue (4×£90=£360) + refreshments (4×£15=£60) + materials ( £2×students ) + fees (3.5%×revenue).
- Contribution ≈ **£165.91 × students − £420**
- Break‑even after fixed + owner pay (~£65 + £300) ≈ **5 students**.

**Cash flow (summary)**

- **Start‑up outlay (Month 0): ~£530** (brand/print £120, website setup £150, demo materials £80, contingency £180).
- **Net cash by month (after owner pay):**

  - M1 £0.46; M2 £0.46; M3 £275.92; M4 £1,019.56; M5 £1,019.56; M6 £1,019.56;
  - M7–M12 **£2,612.52** each (steady‑state).

- **Cum. break‑even including start‑up:** **Month 4**.
- **Year‑end cash generation (after owner pay, before tax):** **£16,083**.

> **Sensitivity** (directional): Each ±1 student per course shifts monthly revenue ≈ **±£522** at steady‑state (3 courses/month).

## 8) Risks & Mitigations

- **Low enrolment:** minimum viable cohort (5), early‑bird pricing, referral incentives, corporate sessions to backfill revenue, roll‑over policy.
- **Venue constraints:** secure secondary venue; maintain portable AV kit; confirm Wi‑Fi.
- **Curriculum churn:** quarterly updates; alumni feedback loop; maintain “what’s new in AI” segment each cohort.
- **Regulatory/data:** publish GDPR/data policy; avoid handling sensitive data in class; consent for recordings/testimonials.

---

## 9) Milestones & KPIs

- **Launch (Weeks 1–4):** website live, first 50 leads, 1st cohort (Beginners) filled to 8+ seats.
- **Quarter 1:** 6+ testimonials, corporate pilot booked, intermediate cohort launched.
- **Quarter 2:** advanced cohort live, 25% repeat/upsell rate, NPS ≥ 60.
- **Quarter 3–4:** steady‑state 3 courses/month, CAC ≤ £35, margin ≥ 55% before owner pay.

**Core KPIs:** enquiries, paid seats/course, attendance %, completion rate, NPS, referral %, CAC/CPA, gross margin, profit after owner pay.
